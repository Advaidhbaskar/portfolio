      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Advaidh Baskar</strong>, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student currently pursuing my B.Tech (CSE Core) at <strong>SRM University, Kattankulathur</strong>. I'm in my second year and hold a CGPA of <strong>8.72</strong> as I continuously work toward mastering both software and problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic journey began at <strong>Sri Sankara Senior Secondary School, Chennai</strong>, where I scored <strong>93%</strong> in my 10th board exams and <strong>88%</strong> in my 12th. Those years helped build my foundation in analytical thinking, discipline, and communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm known for being a <strong>fast learner</strong>, a strong <strong>team player</strong>, and someone who thrives in challenging environments. I’m deeply interested in <strong>software development, front-end engineering, and AI-driven applications</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm fluent in programming languages such as <strong>C, C++, Python, and Java</strong>. I’ve completed certifications in:
        <ul>
          <li>Udemy - C and C++</li>
          <li>Data Flair - C++</li>
          <li>NPTEL - Java Programming</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I bring the same energy and discipline into sports. I’m a <strong>state and district-level karate champion</strong>, have represented in <strong>district-level cricket</strong>, and actively played <strong>school volleyball</strong>. These experiences taught me commitment, leadership, and handling pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently looking for opportunities to intern, collaborate on projects, and grow in the fields of <strong>front-end development, AI, and software engineering</strong>.
